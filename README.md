# SPABA_supplement
Here, we provide the supplemental results for the numerical experiments in our paper and the revised manuscript.

$\textbf{Revised Manuscript}$

In response to the suggestions from the reviewers, we have provided a revised manuscript, detailed in "SPABA__revised_manuscript.pdf".

$\textbf{Numerical Experiments}$

We conducted ten repeated experiments for each of the three numerical experiments discussed in the paper, namely: data hypercleaning on the MNIST dataset, hyperparameter selection on the covtype dataset, and hyperparameter selection on the IJCNN1 dataset, providing their variance results. 
The results of these experiments are available in separate JPG files, with file names composed of the type of numerical experiment and the dataset used. 

Specifically:

The file "Hypercleaning_MINST.jpg" is a schematic representation of the data hypercleaning experiment results on the MNIST dataset, corresponding to Figure 1.(a) in the original paper. 

The files "Hyperparameter_selection_covtype.jpg" and "Hyperparameter_selection_covtype_all.jpg" depict the hyperparameter selection experiment results on the covtype dataset. 
"Hyperparameter_selection_covtype.jpg" corresponds to Figure 1.(b) in the original paper, while "Hyperparameter_selection_covtype_all.jpg" extends this by including comparisons with the MA-SABA, SABA, AmlGO, SRBA, and SOBA algorithms, corresponding to Figure 5 in the original paper. 

The file "Hyperparameters_selection_IJCNN1.jpg" represents the hyperparameter selection experiment on the IJCNN1 dataset, aligning with Figure 6 in the original paper.
